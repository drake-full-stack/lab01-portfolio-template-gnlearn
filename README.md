## üìù Reflection

After completing this lab, write a few sentences about:
- What was the most challenging part?
- What did you learn about semantic HTML?
- How do you plan to expand this portfolio?

One challenging thing with this lab was learning the width and height attributes for the images because I wasn't sure how to scale them to a resonable size. The other challenging part was figuring out the proper organization tree with body around header and main (confused body and main). I knew the basics p, header, body, b, h1 of html, but I didn't know the other tags. There are so many more to learn. After learning more about the tree structure I felt that the semantic html provided organized and easily readable information. Right now the standard font colors and organization can be improved with CSS and box spacing. The site can be expanded with my projects, maybe by adding a backend, so the user can interact with the project while staying on the page.
